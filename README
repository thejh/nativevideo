This is a project for playing Youtube HTML5 in mplayer instead of
the browser's video implementation. Advantages:

 - speed (chromium hogs over 50% of my CPU for HTML5 video, mplayer
   needs much less)
 - the browser doesn't have to be open
 - starting another video automatically stops the previous one
 - in audio only mode, the player is entirely invisible and doesn't
   consume any resources for decoding video data (so it's even faster
   - think of listening to music from youtube with ~5% CPU usage)

Of course, there are disadvantages:

 - doesn't work with flash-only-videos
 - ugly GUI that asks you whether you want to use youtube's player or
   the native one and whether you want video or just audio
 - you need a webserver and have to add a CGI script to it
 - you have to give everyone who can run code in the context of the
   webserver the right to play music and videos in your desktop session
 - DISPLAY is hardcoded to ":0"

Installation:

 - if you don't want every user on your system to be able to play
   music and videos in your session, make sure the repository folder is
   owned by you, has its group set to www-data and has mode 0750
 - insert a password of your choice in nativevideo.c and nativevideo.user.js
 - replace /home/jann with your home folder in nativevideo.c
 - compile the cgi program (`gcc -Wall -Werror -g -o nativevideo nativevideo.c`)
 - allow the cgi program to do stuff in your name by running `chmod 06755 nativevideo`
 - make a link from your CGI directory to `nativevideo` (the compiled program)
   and make sure that your webserver is configured to honor the link
 - install the userscript (`nativevideo.user.js`) in your browser

Everything should work now.
